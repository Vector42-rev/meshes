This outputs for the meshes are also present in the folder. I learnt from the gmsh tutorial to make these meshes. The link to the tutotial is available here.

Examples:-

![mesh_out](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ecb5f9e-dd85-45b7-96be-7e7c6a20b21f)
Ellipse with a Elliptic hole

![holes_with_unequal_radii](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79cc4c3a-bc34-49ef-8940-9b8201c5ae46)

Circle with two holes.

In the code, the order and mesh size can be modified to generate diffferent meshes. Also the mesh size can be modified at specific points to created unstructured meshes.
